# Seminarfach - Smart Home

In the A-Levels, we wrote our Seminarfacharbeit (Coursework) about Smart Home. To deliver a cool and proper technical perspective, our group decided to create a model that behaves similar to a reallife KNX system.
While my teammates were responsible for other topics about Smart Home, my task was to develop the model.

The first version was just a piece of plexiglass on a piece of wood, and the second was a "real" home, made from wood with about one meter in length. Though did both versions include the same technology.

1. Konstantlichtregelung (constant light automation) - this system dims a LED based on the current brightness within the room
2. Heizungssteuerung - this system automatically recognized presence of a person within a room, then sets current temperature goal and decided wether it needs to heat or not; the current mode and temperature was also shown on a little LCD
3. Dimmer - actually just a regular dimmer

## Disclaimer

Of course the code could need optimization, but please keep in mind that I wrote the code on an evening within my A-Levels.
Also did the code work bug free so far, and we got best grade.ðŸ¤“
